### Hi there. I'm Leigh, an Aussie 🇦🇺 software engineer. I care about creating for an open and equitable future. I'm passionate about open source and simplicity.

🔭 I build the [Stellar] network and its [Wasm]-powered contract runtime at the [Stellar Development Foundation][SDF].

💻 I develop with [Rust], [Go], and [TypeScript] ([Deno]).

📚 I am experimenting with [Zig].
