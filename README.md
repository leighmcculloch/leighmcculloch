### Hi there. I'm Leigh, an Aussie ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º software engineer. I'm passionate about open source and simplicity, and enjoy building SDKs, backends and tools with [Go], [Rust], [Ruby], [Wasm], [Deno], [PostgreSQL], and other tech.

ðŸ”­ I build the [Stellar] network and its [Wasm]-powered contract runtime at the [Stellar Development Foundation][SDF].

ðŸ’» I develop with [Rust], [Go], and [TypeScript] ([Deno]).

ðŸ“š I am experimenting with [Zig].
