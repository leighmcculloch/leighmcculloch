### Hi there. I'm Leigh, an Aussie ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º software engineer. I'm passionate about open source and simplicity, and enjoy building SDKs, backends and tools with [Go], [PostgreSQL], [Rust], [Ruby], and other tech.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building the [WASM] powered [Soroban] platform for the [Stellar] network at the [Stellar Development Foundation][SDF].

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning [Rust] and [Zig].
