### Hi there. I'm Leigh, an Aussie ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º software engineer. I'm passionate about open source and simplicity, and enjoy building SDKs, backends and tools with [Go], [Rust], [Ruby], [WASM], [PostgreSQL], and other tech.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m building the [Soroban] execution platform for the [Stellar] network at the [Stellar Development Foundation][SDF]. It's powered by [WASM].

ðŸ’» I'm developing with [Rust] and [Go].

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m learning [Zig].
